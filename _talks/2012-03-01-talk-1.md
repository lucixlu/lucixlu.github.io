Mapping with herders: Integrating remote sensing and household survey at parcel level 
======

The motivation for this study is to enhance our understanding of the linkage among land tenure, herdersâ€™ land management practices and grassland change by 1) pairing micro-level land users data with the specific land parcels that directly reflect their land-use decisions, and 2) taking account of the influence of rainfall variation, a key biophysical variable, which when overlooked often leads studies to exaggerate anthropogenic impact.
