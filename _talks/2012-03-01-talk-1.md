Mapping with herders: Integrating remote sensing and household survey at parcel level 
----





A geographic analysis of the vulnerabilities and coping strategies of tibetan herders in Gansu, China
----
A dominant narrative of rangeland degradation in western China is that degradation is caused by overstocking and poor land use practices. Consequently, the state has designed and implemented a series of grassland policies (e.g., privatizing common grazing land, depopulating livestock, and relocating herders) in pastoral regions of China. Although communal rangeland management is often considered as inefficient and unsustainable, collective rangeland management persists. Using Machu County in Gansu Province as a case study, I examined the differences between de jure and de facto land tenure on eastern Tibetan Plateau. I employed semi-structured interviews and extensive participant observation with 43 Amdo Tibetan herders in Machu County, Gansu province, Western China. Research findings show that instead of herding individually and maximizing the economic benefit, the majority of herders are still pooling resources communally in kin-based encampments in order to avoid risks. Because of the spatio-temporal variation of precipitation, certain encampments perceive themselves more vulnerable to water shortage and topography-related hazards.
