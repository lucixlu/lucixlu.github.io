About me
------
Hello! I am a PhD student working with [Dr. Brian Robinson]("http://www.brianerobinson.com") at the [Department of Geography]("https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/in") of McGill University. I am broadly interested in land system science, Geographic information science, and political ecology. My current research focuses on social-ecological modelling at the household level using earth observation data and household surveys.My dissertation aim to understand the complexities of rangeland socio-ecological systems, especially the dynamics among land tenure insecurity, herdersâ€™ livelihoods, and rainfall variability.
