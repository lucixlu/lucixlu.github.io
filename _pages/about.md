About me
------
Hello! My name is Luci. I am a Ph.D student working with [Brian Robinson]("http://www.brianerobinson.com")in the [Department of Geography]("https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/in") at McGill University. I am broadly interested in land system science, remote sensing & GIS, rangeland ecology, and political ecology. My reserach focuses social-ecological modeling at household-level using earth observation data and household survey. My dissertation reserach focuses on understanding the complexities of rangeland socio-ecological systems, especially the dynamics among land tenure insecurity, herders' livelihoods, and rainfall variability. I adopt methods from rangeland ecology and geographic information-remote sensing science to monitor long-term biomass and precipitation change at household level. To examine the different sources and degrees of tenure insecurity that herders perceive, I draw from institutional economics and development literature to design household surveys and experiments.
