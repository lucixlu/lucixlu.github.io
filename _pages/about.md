About me
------
Hello! I am a PhD student working with [Brian Robinson]("http://www.brianerobinson.com") in the [Department of Geography]("https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/in") at McGill University. I am broadly interested in land system science, remote sensing, GIS, and political ecology. My current research focuses on social-ecological modelling at the household level using earth observation data and household surveys. My dissertation aims to understand the complexities of rangeland socio-ecological systems, especially the dynamics among land tenure insecurity, herdersâ€™ livelihoods, and rainfall variability.
