About me
------
Hello! I am a PhD student at the [Department of Geography]("https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/in") of McGill University. I am interested in land system science and geographic information science. My current research focuses on social-ecological modelling at the household level. Using earth observation and household survey data, I seek to better understand the complexities of rangeland socio-ecological systems, especially the dynamics among land tenure insecurity, herdersâ€™ livelihoods, and rainfall variability.
