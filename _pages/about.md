About me
------
Hello! I am a PhD student at the [Department of Geography]("https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/") of McGill University. I am interested in land system science, geospatial analysis, and political ecology. My current research, advised by [Brian Robinson]("http://www.brianerobinson.com/"), focuses on social-ecological modelling at the household level. Using earth observation and household survey data, I seek to better understand the complexities of rangeland socio-ecological systems, especially the dynamics among land tenure insecurity, herdersâ€™ livelihoods, and rainfall variability.
