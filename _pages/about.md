About me
------
Hello! My name is Luci. I am a Ph.D student working with [Brian Robinson]("http://www.brianerobinson.com") in the [Department of Geography]("https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/in") at McGill University. I am broadly interested in land system science, remote sensing & GIS, and political ecology. My current reseach focuses on social-ecological modeling at household-level using earth observation data and household survey. My dissertation aims to understand the complexities of rangeland socio-ecological systems, especially the dynamics among land tenure insecurity, herders' livelihoods, and rainfall variability.
